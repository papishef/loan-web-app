                        Yes, the better your credit rating the higher your chances for getting the lowest interest rates on your loan. 
                        For those with a bad credit profile, the higher interest rates signifies the increased risk on our part in lending you money.

                        Generally, getting a loan with us is very easy and in few steps. But being accepted comes with a few prerequisites.
                        This will depend entirely upon the nature of your loan request and your employment or business history (Since our 
                        loaning system is backed by the "No Collateral Policy"). We have loans for everyone though, 
                        and so it is unlikely that you will not be accepted for any loans at all.

                        Interest rates are generally higher on shorter term loans, as there are increased administration costs in setting up the 
                        loan.

                        Depending on the loan amount, time it takes to meet the application requirements and application time frame, there may be a waiting period before you receive funds. Some 
                        loans process within 48 hours, but others may take a bit longer (usually a maximum of 1 week). Take these time periods into account when deciding which 
                        loan product to apply for.

                        Generally speaking, you will need your social security and basic employment and income information to apply for a loan with us. 
                        Once we receive the application, we will determine if any additional information is required. 
                        Also youâ€™ll need to verify your identity, and state the purpose for your loan.

                        Depending on your credit score and other factors, the interest rate may impact your decision to borrow. Think of an 
                        interest rate as an expense for borrowing money from a lender. The amount of interest is bundled with your payments.
